            <h4>LeArNER</h4>
            <p>
                Our proposed NER model for legal texts, LeArNER, utilizes minimal annotated data for model training to reduce expenses associated with corpus collection and training. We evaluated our model on a dataset of constitutional legal cases from Taiwan, written in traditional Chinese, and achieved an impressive F1 score of 94.88% for 13 entity types. LeArNER's performance was best achieved with a training sample of only 2000 sentences, highlighting its efficiency and potential for further legal NER research.

            <h4>Legal text 標記器</h4>
            <p>
                This tool allows users to upload their legal documents and submit them for annotation using the LeArNER model we have trained. In addition to automated annotation, users can also manually tag entities within the documents. This dual functionality ensures both efficiency and accuracy in legal document processing, catering to a variety of user needs.

                This study investigates cultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on cross-cultural representation. Focusing on autonomous vehicle ethics and health decision-making, it examines LLMs' handling of culturally-sensitive scenarios. The research aims to develop strategies for enhancing cultural diversity in LLMs, improving fairness, and informing global governance frameworks.
